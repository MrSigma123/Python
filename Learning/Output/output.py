# here is an comment! below there are different outputs

# you can use the newline escape sequence
print("Hello\nWorld!")

# you can use doublequotes and single quotes in special ways
print("A 'single quote' inside a double quote")
print('A "double quote" inside a single quote')
print("Alternatively you can just \"escape\" the quote")

# as you see doublequotes and singlequotes can be used interchangeably

# you can easily concatenate strings
print("Hello" + "America!")

# to add the space between you have to type it
print("Hello" + " " + "America!")
# or
print("Hello " + "America!")
# or
print("Hello" + " America!")

# you have to be cautious because indentation really matters in python
